Learning to Program with F#
===========================

Programming is the art of solving problems by writing a program to be executed by a computer, and this book has been written as an introduction to programming for novice programmers. 

This book uses F#, also known as Fsharp, which is a functional-first programming language, meaning that it is designed as a functional programming language that also supports imperative and object-oriented programming. It was originally developed for Microsoft's .Net platform but is available as open source for many operating systems through Mono. As an introduction to programming, F# is a young programming language still under development, with syntax that at times is a bit complex. Still, it offers many advantages:
* Interactive and compile mode: F# has an interactive and compile mode of operation. In interactive mode, you can write code that is executed immediately like working with a calculator, while in compile mode you combine many lines of code possibly in many files into a single application, which is easier to distribute to people who are not F# experts and is faster to execute.
* Indentation for scope: F# uses indentation to indicate scope. Some lines of code belong together and should be executed in a certain order and may share data. Indentation helps in specifying this relationship.
* Strongly typed: F# is strongly typed, reducing the number of runtime errors. That is, F# is picky, and will not allow the programmer to mix up types such as numbers and text. This is a great advantage for large programs.
* Multi-platform: F# is available on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, GPUs, and browsers both via the public domain Mono platform and Microsoft's open-source .Net system.
* Free to use and open source: F# is supported by the Fsharp foundation (https://fsharp.org) and sponsored by Microsoft.
* Assemblies: F# is designed to be able to easily communicate with other .Net and Mono programs through the language-independent, platform-independent byte code called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) organized as assemblies. Thus, if you find that certain parts of a program are easy to express in F# and others in C++, then you will be able to combine these parts later into a single program.
* Modern computing: F# supports all aspects of modern computing including Graphical User Interfaces, Web programming, Information-rich programming, Parallel algorithms, ...
* Integrated development environments (IDE): F# is supported by IDEs such as Visual Studio (https://www.visualstudio.com) and Xamarin Studio (https: //www.xamarin.com).

It is used in the first programming course at the University of Copenhagen's bachelor in computer science program.
