\item Add something on piping (if not already in Torben's notes)
\item Add abstraction of computer: places <-> memory/disk. Mutable
  objects are abstractions of places
  \url{https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values}. Facts does
  not rime with set and get. 
\item Hickey: Difference between syntax and semantics. Values or
  locations, add a good figure. Functional programming: All values are
  freely shareable.
