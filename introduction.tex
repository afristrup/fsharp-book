\chapter{Introduction}

Programming is the act of solving a problem by writing a program to be executed on a computer. A general method for solving problems was given by George Pólya~\cite{polya45} and adapted to programming is:
\begin{description}
\item[Understand the problem:] To solve any problem it is crucial that the problem formulation is understood, and questions like: What is to be solved? Do you understand everything in the problem description. Is all information for finding the solution available or is something missing?
\item[Design a plan:] Good designs means that programs are faster to program easier to debug and maintain. So before you start typing a program consider things like: What are the requirements and constraints for the program? Which components should the program have? How are these components to work together? Designing often involves drawing a diagram of the program, and writing pseudo-code on paper.
\item[Implement the plan:] Implementation is the act of transforming a program design into a code. A crucial part of any implementation is choosing which programming language to use. Also, the solution to many problems will have a number of implementations which vary in how much code they require, to which degree they rely on external libraries, which programming style the are best suited for, what machine resources they require, and what their running times are.  With a good design, then the coding is usually easy, since the design will have uncovered the major issues and found solutions for these, but sometimes implementation reveals new problems, which requires rethinking the design. Most implementations also include writing documentation of the code.
\item[Reflect on the result:] A crucial part in any programming task is ensuring that the program solves the problem sufficiently. E.g., what are the program's bugs, is the documentation of the code sufficient and relevant for its intended use. Is the code easily maintainable and extendable by other programmers. Are there any general lessons to be learned from or general code developed by the programming experience, which may be used for future programming sessions?
\end{description}
Programming is a very complicated process, and the steps in Pólya's list are almost always to be performed, but the order of the steps and the number of times each step is performed varies. \jon{Should we mention core activities: Requirements, Design, Construction, Testing, Debugging, Deployment, Maintenance?}

This book focusses on 3 fundamentally different approaches to programming: 
\begin{description}
\item[Imperative programming,]\idxs{Imperative programming} which is a type of programming that \idx{statements} to change the program's \idx{state}. Imperative programming emphasises \emph{how a program shall accomplish a solution} and less on\emph{what the solution is}. A cooking recipes is an example of the spirit of imperative programming. Almost all computer hardware is designed to execute low-level programs written in imperative style. The first major language was FORTRAN~\cite{backus54} which emphasized imperative style of programming.
\item[Declarative programming,]\idxs{Declarative programming} which emphasises \emph{what a program shall accomplish} but not \emph{how}. We will consider Functional programming as a type of declarative programming. \idxs{Functional programming} A type of programming which evaluates \idx{functions} and avoids state changes. The program consists of \idx{expressions} instead of statements. As a consequence, the output of functions only depends on its arguments. Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus~\cite{church32}, and the first language emphasizing functional programming was Lisp~\cite{mccarthy60}. 
\item[Structured programming,]\idxs{Structured programming}, which emphasises organisation of code in units with well defined interfaces and isolation of internal states and code from other parts of the program. We will focus on Object-oriented programming is the example of structured programming. \idxs{Object-orientered programming} is a type of programming, where the states and programs are structured into \idx{objects}. A typical object-oriented design takes a problem formulation and identifies key nouns as potential objects and verbs as potential actions to be take on objects. The first object-oriented programming language was Simula~67 developed by Dahl and Nygaard at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo.
\end{description}
Most programs follows a single programming paradigm as, e.g., one of the above, but are a mix. Nevertheless, this book will treat each paradigm separately to emphasize their advantages and disadvantages.

This book uses F\# also known as Fsharp, which is a functional first programming language that also supports imperativ and object oriented programming. It was originally developed for Microsoft's .Net platform, but is available as open source for many operating systems through Mono. As an introduction to programming, F\# is a young programming language still under development, with syntax that at times is a bit complex, but it offers a number of advantages:
\begin{description}
\item[Interactive and compile mode] F\# has an interactive and a compile mode of operation.
\item[Indentation for scope] F\# uses indentation to indicate scope.
\item[Strongly typed] F\# is strongly typed, reducing the number of run-time errors.
\item[Multi-platform] F\# is available on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, GPUs, and browsers via the Mono platform.
\item[Free to use and open source] F\# is supported by the Fsharp foundation (\url{http://fsharp.org}) and sponsored by Microsoft.
\item[Assemblies] F\# programs interface easily with other .Net and Mono programs through the language-independent, platform-independent bytecode called Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
\item[Modern computing] F\# supports all aspects of modern computing including Graphical User Interfaces, Web programming, Information rich programming, Parallel algorithms, \dots
\item[Integrated development environments (IDE)] F\# is supported by major IDEs such as Visual Studio (\url{https://www.visualstudio.com}) and Xamarin Studio (\url{https://www.xamarin.com}).
\end{description}

Learning to program requires mastering a programming language, however most programming languages contains details that are rarely used or used in contexts far from a specific programming topic. Hence, this book takes the approach to start with an introduction to the most basic concepts of F\# in Part~\ref{part:basics}, followed by the 3 programming paradigms in Part~\ref{part:imperative}--\ref{part:structured} while gradually expanding the introduction of F\# syntax and semantics. In Part~\ref{part:appendix} are a number of general topics given for reference. The disadvantage of this approach is that no single part contains a reference guide to F\# and F\# topics are revisited and expanded across the book.
