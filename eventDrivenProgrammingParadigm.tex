\chapter{The Event-driven programming paradigm}
\label{chap:eventDriven}

In \idx{event-driven programming}, the flow of the program is determined by \idx{events} such as the user moving the mouse, an alarm going off, a message arrives from another program, or an exception is thrown, and is very common for programs with extensive interaction with a user such as a graphical user-interface. The events are monitored by \idx{listeners}, and the programmer can \idx{handlers}, which are \idx{call-back} functions to be executed when an event occurs. In event-driven programs, there is almost always a main loop, to which the program relinquishes control to when all handlers have been set up. Event-driven programs can be difficult to test since they often rely on difficult to automate mechanisms for triggering events, e.g., testing a graphical user-interface often requires users to point-and-click, which is very slow compared to automatic unit-testing.
